# oasis-node-setup

This set of instructions is pulled together from:
* https://docs.oasis.dev/operators/joining-the-testnet.html
* https://docs.oasis.dev/operators/current-testnet-parameters.html
* https://docs.oasis.dev/operators/maintenance/handling-network-upgrades.html

Although they seem to work, please bear in mind that I've forgotten what Oasis actually does (and I've no interest in finding out). If the project lasts a year I'll be surprised.
